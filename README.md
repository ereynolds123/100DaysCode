100 Days of Code Challenge 2

I will be working on 100 days of code challenge. 

Day 1 12/17/2021:
Progress: Got Java environment up and running. Got my repo set up. Compiled a hello world. 
Emotions/Feelings: This is very challenging. Set up always seems to be the most complicated, but it is so exciting when Hello, World finally works!
