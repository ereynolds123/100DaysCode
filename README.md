100 Days of Code Challenge 2

I will be working on 100 days of code challenge. Begins 12/17/2021 - 3/27/2022.

Day 1: 12/17/2021
Progress: Got Java environment up and running. Got my repo set up. Compiled a hello world. 
Emotions/Feelings: This is very challenging. Set up always seems to be the most complicated, but it is so exciting when Hello, World finally works!

Day 2: 12/18/2021
Progress: Got bot to send text messages. Set up https://github.com/ereynolds123/twc-20211217
Emotions/Feelings: This was really fun today! I liked pairing! I am excited about this project. 

Day 3: 12/19/2021
Progress: Got the bot to send random messages. 
Emotions/Feelings: This was a pretty good day. The first half hour took a long time, but getting the random messages was pretty enjoyable. 

Day 4: 12/20/2021
Progress: Got a form submitting and resetting on the To do app. Only problem is the title of the fields is duplicating.
Emotions/Feelings: Felt pretty good. Nice to code while working. I wish this strange bug wasn't coming up. 

Day 5: 12/21/2021
Progress: To do app is creating list elements and deleting elements on the To Do app. There is a bug that the second task is duplicating the task. 
Emotions/Feelings: Today felt pretty good. I didn't really get to into the bug. Seems similar to the bug I was seeing yesterday. Not sure how to fix it. 

Day 6: 12/22/2021
Progress: Created an income/tax/deductions calculator.
Emotions: Today was really exciting. I am starting to look forward to my time coding. Like today I built something useful. I can accurately estimate how much I will have for every pay check (which will change a fair bit because I don't get paid for vacation.)

Day 7: 12/24/2021
Progress: Created a JS clock. Began my Girls of Spotify scraper. Set up complete. Processing natural language and outputting all full names in a text 
Emotions: JS clock was super easy. The Girls of Spotify is a really cool project I have wanted to do for a while. The feeling I got when the NLKT processor compiles was like nothing else! I love coding today.... even though I have no idea where to go from here.
