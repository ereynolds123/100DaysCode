100 Days of Code Challenge 2

I will be working on 100 days of code challenge. Begins 12/17/2021 - 3/27/2022.

Day 1 12/17/2021:
Progress: Got Java environment up and running. Got my repo set up. Compiled a hello world. 
Emotions/Feelings: This is very challenging. Set up always seems to be the most complicated, but it is so exciting when Hello, World finally works!

Day 2 12/18/2021:
Progress: Got bot to send text messages. Set up https://github.com/ereynolds123/twc-20211217
Emotions/Feelings: This was really fun today! I liked pairing! I am excited about this project.
